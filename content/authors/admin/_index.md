My research focuses on the evolution of sociality in lizards with a particular interest in the role of kin recognition. Specifically, I am interested in the role of kin recognition itself, its importance in the early evolution of sociality and how it becomes refined as social systems become increasingly complex. While I am based at the University of Tasmania ([BEER group](https://beergrouputas.wordpress.com/)), my field and experimental work takes place at the Macquarie University in Sydney ([Lizardlab](https://whitinglab.com/)).

Before moving to Australia I completed both my Master's and Bachelor's at the University of Antwerp, Belgium. During this time I studied animal personalities in birds for my Master's thesis and took part in a project on urbanisation and island effects in lizards.
